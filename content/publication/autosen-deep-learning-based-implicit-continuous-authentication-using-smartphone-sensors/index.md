abstract: Smartphones have become crucial for our daily life activities and are
  increasingly loaded with our personal information to perform several sensitive
  tasks, including, mobile banking and communication, and are used for storing
  private photos and files. Therefore, there is a high demand for applying
  usable authentication techniques that prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
  information. In this article, we propose AUToSen, a deep-learning-based active
  authentication approach that exploits sensors in consumer-grade smartphones to
  authenticate a user. Unlike conventional approaches, AUToSen is based on deep
  learning to identify user distinct behavior from the embedded sensors with and
  without the user's interaction with the smartphone. We investigate different
  deep learning architectures in modeling and capturing users' behavioral
  patterns for the purpose of authentication. Moreover, we explore the
  sufficiency of sensory data required to accurately authenticate users. We
  evaluate AUToSen on a real-world data set that includes sensors data of 84
  participants' smartphones collected using our designed data-collection
  application. The experiments show that AUToSen operates accurately using
  readings of only three sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer)
  with a high authentication frequency, e.g., one authentication attempt every
  0.5 s. Using sensory data of one second enables an authentication F1-score of
  approximately 98%, false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.95%, false rejection rate
  (FRR) of 6.67%, and equal error rate (EER) of 0.41%. While using sensory data
  of half a second enables an authentication F1-score of 97.52%, FAR of 0.96%,
  FRR of 8.08%, and EER of 0.09%. Moreover, we investigate the effects of using
  different sensory data at variable sampling periods on the performance of the
  authentication models under various settings and learning architectures.
